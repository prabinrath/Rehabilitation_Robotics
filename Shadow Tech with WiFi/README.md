## Shadow technique
The code runs in alliance with the hardware that uses ESP32 for sending the joint roll angles from MPU9250 to the system using UDP protocol. The PID controller tries to reach the angle obtained by passing the real angle through the inverse kinametics function(specific for the mechnical design).
